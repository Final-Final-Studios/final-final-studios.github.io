Privacy Policy for Black Hat Cooperative

Effective Date: 10/14/2025
Last Updated: 10/14/2025

Final Final Studios LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our video game Black Hat Cooperative (the “Game”).

1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or gameplay data from players.
Specifically:

We do not collect names, email addresses, or contact information.

We do not collect location data.

We do not collect gameplay analytics or usage statistics.

We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

We do not connect to any third-party analytics, advertising, or social media services.

If you play the Game through a third-party platform (such as Steam, Meta, or PlayStation), that platform may collect data under its own privacy policy. We do not receive or control that information.

2. Children’s Privacy

Our Game does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under 13 years of age.
If you believe your child has provided any personal information to us, please contact us, and we will promptly delete it.

3. Third-Party Services

The Game may run on third-party platforms (Steam, Meta, PlayStation).
Please review the privacy policies of those platforms to understand what data they may collect or process independently from us.

4. Data Retention

Because we do not collect or store personal data, we retain no user information of any kind.

5. Security

We do not collect or store user data, so there is no user information to secure.
We nonetheless take reasonable measures to ensure the Game itself is distributed safely and free of malicious code.

6. Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there are no personal records to access, modify, or delete.
If you contact us with a question about privacy, we will respond promptly.

7. Changes to This Policy

If our practices change in the future (for example, if we add optional online features), we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and post the revised version with a new “Effective Date.”
